<h1>Help</h1>
<h2>I found a description of materials that interest me. How do I get those materials?</h2>

<p>You have three options for getting materials: Look at them online, visit an institution in person, or contact the institution to get copies of materials.</p>

<p>If the material is online, you'll see that indicated with "digital objects available" in the search results or in the description with "yes" or "no." If it indicates "yes," you can see a gallery of digital objects associated with that collection. You can get more information about those objects by clicking on them. In most cases, only a few items from a collection have been digitized.</p>

<p>If the materials are not online, you'll need either to visit in person or contact the institution to get copies. Each collection description has information on the holding institution and their complete contact information (website, phone, email). The <a href="/contact.php">Contact page</a> also has information on open hours and getting copies.</p>

<h2>I found a problem on this website. Who do I contact?</h2>

<p>If you found a problem with the content of a finding aid, contact the owning repository.</p>

<p>For other issues, you can submit the <a href="https://www.orbiscascade.org/about/contact/forms/website-problem-report/">Website Problem Report Form</a> to contact the Orbis Cascade Alliance.</p>

<h2>My institution wants to contribute finding aids to Archives West. How can we do that?</h2>
